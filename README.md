# github-action-template

An opinionated github actions template

## Usage

Before you start, you need to do the following to setup the project:

- Find and replace all `github-action-template` with your project name
- Update the License
- Update the README.md

> [!NOTE]
> You should probably remove the `test-action.yaml` workflow, and move it to a different repository.
> This will make it easier to test the action in a real repository, without having all the noise of the action repository.
